## Bearthday Coding Challenge

The Bearthday challenge was really fun to do. I enjoyed implementing NASA's EPIC API and getting the images from the server and loading them into the client.  I chose to use React/Redux to develop the application.

When loading a bearthday image, the first image will load and will only start to animate upon the completion of the loading of all the images.
